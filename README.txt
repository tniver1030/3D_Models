			MendelMaxParts

What
---------
The folder 'MendelMaxParts' contains parts designed for the Mendel Max 1.5 3D printer. There are two redesigns
which I created from scratch. STLs are provided for easy viewing.
Images of them in use can also be found in the same folder.

Features
---------
	X-End
The X-End was redigned based off of the Gadgets3D design. It was made so that it could be more easily printed
and be printed in one piece total. The piece was also designed to be more structurally solid.
	X-Plate
The X-Plate was redisigned based off of the Gadgets3D design. The belt holders were brought out and more grooves
were added for better belt tensioning, a fan holder was added for good hot-end ventilation, and two limit switch 
holders were added to each side so that the limit switches would be static (They used to slide if bumped too 
quickly).
